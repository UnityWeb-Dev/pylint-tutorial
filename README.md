# PyLint Tutorial
This repository is a startup for any python oriented projects of this organisation.

Welcome to the Pylint Tutorial repository! This tutorial will guide you through setting up Pylint for Python code linting in your projects.

## Introduction

Pylint is a tool for analyzing Python code for errors, enforcing coding standards, and identifying code smells. This tutorial aims to provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to get started with Pylint, configure it according to your project's requirements, and integrate it into your development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this tutorial, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure pip is installed by default with Python.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Pylint in your project:

1. **Create a Python virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment on Unix/Linux
   # Or use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```
2. **Install PyLint**: 
```
pip install pylint
```

## Configuration
Pylint can be configured using a .pylintrc file. You can generate a default configuration file by running:
```
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
Customize .pylintrc according to your project's coding standards and preferences.
```

## Usage
To use Pylint in your development workflow:

1. **Run Pylint**:
```
pylint your_python_file.py
Replace your_python_file.py with the path to your Python file or directory.
```
2. **Integrate with IDEs**:
Pylint can be integrated with various IDEs/editors (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) to get real-time linting feedback as you write code.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully set up Pylint in your project. This tutorial covered the basics of installation, configuration, and usage of Pylint. Feel free to explore more Pylint configurations and rules to tailor it further to your project's needs.
